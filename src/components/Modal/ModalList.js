    the challenge was to create a paint app. This project showed me the importance of 
    communication of team goals. Using Jira to make sure everyone is on the same page 
    and proper branch management. This was my first group project with a designer. 
    Which showed me having a designer is a must going forth`

    We used React for the front-end and a node js express server for the backend. 
    This project was incredibly valuable. We used a Jira board. Which taught me 
    so much about dividing tasks among the group. Also learned about merging and 
    dealing with conflicts with other people's codes.`
