    Where you can actually log in and talk to other authenticated users. Front-end using 
    React and for the backend Firebase for the database. I wanted to teach myself more

    modalDescription: `Scratch-Paint is a hackathon group project. In the hackathon, 
    the challenge was to create a paint app with a max of two developers and one designer. 
    This project showed me the importance of communication of team goals. Using Jira to 
    make sure everyone is on the same page and proper branch management. This was my first 
    group project with a designer. Which opened my eyes to how a designer can really bring 
    a website to life with design alone.`

    modalDescription: `InStock is a warehouse site made with my BrainStation classmates. 
    We used React for the front-end and a node js express server for the backend. 
    This project was incredibly valuable. We used a Jira board. Which taught me 
    so much about dividing tasks among the group. Also learned about merging and 
    dealing with conflicts with other people's codes.`

    for the last day of the BrainStations 3 month dev program. On 
    project day I received the most business cards in the class from 
    recruiters. Recruiters were more impressed that a carpenter could 
    learn and apply so much to a project without having any experience of code.`
